   - Should look like: `https://finance.yahoo.com/portfolio/p_12/view/v1`
   - Must include the `/portfolio/p_XX` part
   - Copy the full URL from your browser's address bar

   - Go to `chrome://extensions/` and check if the extension shows permission warnings
   - Click "Details" and ensure all permissions are granted

4. **Manual Holdings Backup**

#### Poor Quality Analysis
**Symptoms**: Analysis seems irrelevant or generic

**Solutions**:

### üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Troubleshooting

#### Portfolio Extraction Debugging
**If portfolio data extraction keeps failing:**

1. **Check Extension Console**
   - Open `chrome://extensions/`
   - Find "Portfolio Impact Analyzer"
   - Click "Inspect views: service worker"
   - Look for console messages starting with "Starting portfolio data extraction..."

2. **Manual Test Process**
   - Open your Yahoo Finance portfolio page manually
   - Press F12 to open developer tools
   - In Console tab, paste this test code:
   ```javascript
   // Test if we can find portfolio data
   console.log('Tables found:', document.querySelectorAll('table').length);
   console.log('Quote links found:', document.querySelectorAll('a[href*="/quote/"]').length);
   console.log('Page text contains symbols:', /\b[A-Z]{2,6}\.[A-Z]{2,3}\b/.test(document.body.textContent));
   ```
   - This will help identify if the page structure is different
