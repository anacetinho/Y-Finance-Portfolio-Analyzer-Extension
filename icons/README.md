# Extension Icons

This directory needs the following PNG icon files for the Chrome extension:

- **icon16.png** - 16x16 pixels
- **icon48.png** - 48x48 pixels
- **icon128.png** - 128x128 pixels

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:

1. **Online tools**: Use services like Canva, Figma, or similar
2. **Free icon generators**: Search for "chrome extension icon generator"
3. **Design software**: Photoshop, GIMP, or similar tools

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use a simple, recognizable symbol (portfolio/chart/finance related)
- Use the brand colors from the extension: #667eea (blue-purple gradient)
- Ensure good contrast and readability at small sizes
- Follow Chrome's icon design guidelines

## Temporary Solution

For testing purposes, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files with the correct names. The extension will load without proper icons, but they're required for a polished experience.

## SVG Templates

The directory contains SVG templates (icon16.svg, icon48.svg, icon128.svg) that you can convert to PNG format using online converters or image editing software.
